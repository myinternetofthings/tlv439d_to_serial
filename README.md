# Magnetic camera

Project aims to get TLV493D magnetic sensor mounted to Universal-Robots UR3 arm, and create accurate 3d maps of magnetic fields.

## Getting Started

I'm using Infineon 3D Magnetic Sensor 2 Go Kit hardware.
For interfacing to magnetic sensor I adapted Arduino library for TLV493D-A1B6.
IDE is Infineons DAVE v4.4.2
